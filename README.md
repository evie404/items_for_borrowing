# Ricky's Items for Borrowing

With the recent breakdowns of my phone, laptop, and camera, I bought a bunch of tools off Amazon in hopes of repairing them. Thankfully, I was able to repair them all without failure, but now I left with a bunch of tools I Probably won't use frequently.

So I decide to make a list of my belongings for people to borrow in the Bay Area. Git is used to track the history of who borrowed what.
